# ue4_audio_looper

### Python ###

Install Python 3 64 bit from here:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe

More info about that is here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

### Directions ###

Open file explorer.  Go a folder that is a level or two deep (not a My PC location such as Documents, Pictures, etc.)
Press Alt + F + S + A in that order, not all at once.
Select yes to the UAC prompt
You should get a PowerShell Window running as admin.  Type exactly:

pip install soundfile

followed by:

pip install numpy

(press enter after typing each; wait for the first one to finish before doing the second).

Then you're good to go.  UE4 Audio Looper.py should always work now.
